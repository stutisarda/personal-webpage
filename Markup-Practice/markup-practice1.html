    <h1>Cheese</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by
            coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows,
            buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet
            causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the
            rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.

            Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced. Their styles, textures and flavors depend
            on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat
            content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging. Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as
            flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as Red Leicester, is produced by adding
            annatto.

        <h2>History</h2>

            <h3>Origins</h3>

            <p>Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history. There is no conclusive evidence
                indicating where cheese making originated, either in Europe, Central Asia or the Middle East, but the
                practice had spread within Europe prior to Roman times and, according to Pliny the Elder, had become a
                sophisticated enterprise by the time the Roman Empire came into being.</p>

            <h3>Ancient Greece and Rome</h3>

            <p>Ancient Greek mythology credited Aristaeus with the discovery of cheese. Homer's <em>Odyssey</em> (8th
                century BCE) describes the Cyclops making and storing sheep's and goats' milk cheese.</p>

            <h3>Post-Roman Europe</h3>

            <p>As Romanized populations encountered unfamiliar newly settled neighbors, bringing their own cheese-making
                traditions, their own flocks and their own unrelated words for cheese, cheeses in Europe diversified
                further, with various locales developing their own distinctive traditions and products. As long-distance
                trade collapsed, only travelers would encounter unfamiliar cheeses: Charlemagne's first encounter with a
                white cheese that had an edible rind forms one of the constructed anecdotes of Notker's Life of the
                Emperor.</p>

            <h3>Modern era</h3>

            <p>Until its modern spread along with European culture, cheese was nearly unheard of in east Asian cultures,
                in the pre-Columbian Americas, and only had limited use in sub-Mediterranean Africa, mainly being
                widespread and popular only in Europe, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and areas influenced by
                those cultures. But with the spread, first of European imperialism, and later of Euro-American culture
                and food, cheese has gradually become known and increasingly popular worldwide, though still rarely
                considered a part of local ethnic cuisines outside Europe, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and
                the Americas.</p>
